# NeoCharity: Improving Charity Transparency via NEO
Charities receive hundreds of billions of dollars in donor money, yet donors canâ€™t reliably earmark their donations for specific causes, and the vast majority of charities do not report full itemized purchase transactions. This tacit trust donors give charities can be formalized if there were a guaranteed way for donated money to be used in its intended purpose and then this money could be tracked to see how it was actually used. 

This seems like a perfect task for smart contracts on the blockchain. For donors, decentralization and transparency ensure money is used as desired. For charities, automatic, secure purchase reporting reduce the tremendous burden of accounting. 

Our solution leverages the NEO blockchain to create such a system
